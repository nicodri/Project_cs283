# Project_cs283

Implementation in matlab of the Parts One-vs-One features proposed by T. Berg in http://thomasberg.org/papers/poof-cvpr13.pdf. To be used you need images in the same format provided by the CUb-200-2011 birds dataset.

The script to use is 'main.m' to run the Poof learning and the one-vs-all classifiers. This script requires some matlab data which need to be formated as in 'load_birds_data.m'

Thanks for reading, feel free to share and send me feedbacks!
